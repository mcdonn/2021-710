# Data management activity

1. Based upon the information your group has been given, create a data management workflow. In so doing, answer the following questions: 

  - How will you collect data? 
  - In what forms will it be recorded?
  - How/when will you process the data?
  - What software will you use?
  - How will you manage metadata? 
  - ...

***Provide a practical and specific plan with an appropriate workflow based upon what you learned from Thieberger & Berez (2012) and Cox (to appear).***
