## Course description
Contemporary language documentation is dedicated to producing a **long-lasting, multipurpose record of a language**. This course will give you the skills you need to produce such a documentation, with special attention given to digital data collection, data sustainability, and the documentation of language-in-use. The skills you develop in this class can be extended to your future fieldwork or toward bringing an existing documentation project in line with current practice. Students will (1) gain an understanding of the current best practices in digital language documentation; (2) develop skills in a prosody-based transcription system that can be applied to any language; (3) become familiar with key software and hardware used in our field; (4) develop skills to troubleshoot data management problems in a variety of fieldwork situations. By the end of the course, students will be able to plan for conducting best-practice language documentation project of their own, from equipment purchase to data collection to data annotation to archiving and presentation.

## Course readings 

The course readings listed in the [course schedule](#course-schedule) can be accessed through [Laulima Resource foler](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/x/gtPBkF) unless they are already available online.

## Required materials

Students are required to have (or have access to) the following:


  1. Computer (preferably a laptop)

  - You may use any operating system (Mac OS, Windows, Linux) except when we are working with FLEx, at which point you will need access to Windows or Linux, either on a PC or through an emulator of some kind.
  - Download the following software in the version listed below:
  
    * [ELAN (version 5.9)](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/download/)
    * [FLEx (version 9.0.9 beta)](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/)
    * [lameta (version 0.8.9-beta)](https://github.com/onset/lameta/releases)

2. Closed-ear/closed back (`circumaural') monitoring headphones (recommended)
  * These headphones will be used with your laptop as well as audio and video recorders.

    * Sennheiser 201, 202 and Audio-Technica ATH-M20 are recommended (Price: \$20--\$45).
    * It may be possible to check out headphones from the lab or borrow them from a fellow student.
    * Note that earbuds or on-ear (`supra-aural') headphones are not recommended.

<!--
    > If students are not already "Advanced Users of the LAE Labs", please do so before week 4. This will allow you to check out recording equipment. See [information on becoming a LAE Labs Advanced User](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/laelabsedit/for-lab-users).
-->

### Instructions for downloading FLEx on virtual machine

Follow the steps provided on these websites in this order: 

  1. Download Ubuntu 16.04.4 [here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Don't do anything else, just have it downloaded before step 2.
  2. Download Virtual Box for OS X [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).[^2] Follow all instructions closely [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819084623/https://linus.nci.nih.gov/bdge/installUbuntu.html), all the way to the bottom of the page.
  3. I noticed that Ubuntu was running very, very slowly. So follow the instructions [here](https://thomas.vanhoutte.be/miniblog/guide-speed-up-ubuntu-virtualbox/) to speed it up and make it actually useful. 
  4. Follow instructions [here](http://packages.sil.org/) to install FLEx (aka: Fieldworks). Note: Follow instructions carefully and read all of the dialogue boxes. It can be a bit tricky. 

[^2]: Apparently, Virtual Box can be very slow at first but improves after you restart your computer several times.

## Grading

  1. Participation & reading responses [**20%** ]{style="float:right"}
  
  * Students are required to be at every class and participate in class discussions of the readings. 
  * When readings are assigned, students are required to send **two responses (approximately 3-5 sentences each) that contain commentary, criticisms, or questions** on the [Laulima forum](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/x/3KQS0k) about the reading **by 8pm on the Tuesday before the reading is to be discussed **. 
  * Each student is required to reply to **two** of their classmates' responses **by 8pm on Wednesday** (approximately 2-4 sentences each).

2. Assignments [**20%** ]{style="float:right"}
  * There will be several short assignments on the topics being discussed in class.
    1. IRB assignment
    2. Metadata assignment
    3. ELAN assignment
    4. FLEx lexicon assignment
    5. FLEx glossing assignment
    6. ELAN-FLEx-ELAN import export assignment
    7. Data management plan
    8. ...

3. Presentations [**20%** ]{style="float:right"}

  * Each student will present once a topic listed below: 
      1. Digital data management in language documentation
      2. Hardware/software for language documentation

4. Audiovisual recording & transcription [**20%** ]{style="float:right"}
  
  * Each student will make a recording of a conversation of at least 1/2 hour.
      * The recording must use video with a separate audio recorder.
      * The audio and video will be synced, edited and exported for transcription in ELAN. 
  * Students will transcribe a small portion of the recording using Discourse Transcription [@dubois1993outline].
  
5. Documentation enrichment project [**20%** ]{style="float:right"}

  * Enrich a portion of either the documentation of Besemah or Nasal. In week 6 of the semester students will begin meeting with me to discuss the areas of the documentation project on which they would like to work. The goal of this project is to give student hands on experience working with documentary materials, using the technical skills that they have learned in this class. Possible projects include the following:
    
    * Prepare and possibly edit audio and video recordings to be archived in PARADISEC or ELAR.
    * Enrich and organize metadata and consent materials.
    * Edit ELAN files to improve the accuracy of alignment and English free translations. 
    * Prepare ELAN files to be imported into FLEx.
    * Export ELAN files into FLEx and gloss different speech events.
    * ...

## Presentations

Students are required to do *two* mini-presentations. These are short 10 minute presentations that explain topics to the class in a concise, useful way. The presentation should provide an overview of the topic with illustrative examples that help other students understand how the topic applies to language documentation. Each presentation should be accompanied by a short presentation and/or a 2 page (single-spaced) handout with relevant information and examples. The handout should serve as a kind of **cheat sheet**.
